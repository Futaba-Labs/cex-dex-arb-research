# Feature Specification: CEX Streams Migration to Connex API

**Feature Branch**: `001-cex-streams-py`
**Created**: 2025-01-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "þ(ncex_streams.pynŸÅ’connex (https://apiconnex.readme.io/reference/introduction) ’cfcexn¡<’Ö—Y‹ˆFk	ôW_D"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Migrate cex_streams.py to use Connex API for CEX price data
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: System (arbitrage bot), Connex API service
   ’ Actions: Retrieve real-time price data from CEXs
   ’ Data: Orderbook data, price quotes
   ’ Constraints: Maintain compatibility with existing aggregator
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which Connex API endpoints to use - REST or WebSocket?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Authentication credentials for Connex API?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which exchanges to support through Connex (Binance, OKX, both)?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Define data streaming scenarios
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must maintain existing system behavior
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Price data streams, orderbook structures
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding API specifics"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an arbitrage system operator, I want to retrieve real-time CEX price data through a unified API service (Connex) instead of directly connecting to multiple exchange WebSockets, so that I can reduce connection complexity and potentially benefit from lower latency and improved reliability.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the arbitrage system is running, **When** requesting ETH/USDT price data, **Then** the system receives real-time orderbook updates through Connex API
2. **Given** multiple trading pairs are configured, **When** the system starts, **Then** price streams for all pairs are established through Connex
3. **Given** a network disconnection occurs, **When** connectivity is restored, **Then** the price stream automatically reconnects and resumes data flow
4. **Given** the existing aggregator expects specific data format, **When** Connex data is received, **Then** it maintains compatibility with current data structures

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Connex API is unavailable or returns errors?
- How does system handle rate limiting from Connex?
- What occurs if Connex doesn't support a requested trading pair?
- How does the system handle data format differences between direct exchange streams and Connex?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST retrieve real-time orderbook data for configured trading pairs through Connex API
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain the same data output format as current implementation for downstream compatibility
- **FR-003**: System MUST support streaming data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which exchanges - Binance only, OKX only, or both?]
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle connection failures and automatically reconnect to maintain data flow
- **FR-005**: System MUST process price updates with minimal additional latency compared to current direct connections
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate with Connex using [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: API key method, OAuth, or other authentication mechanism?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST support the same trading pairs currently supported (ETH/USDT, ETH/USDC)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide debug logging capability to monitor connection status and data flow
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: REST API polling or WebSocket streaming for real-time data?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST respect Connex API rate limits [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what are the rate limits?]

### Key Entities
- **Price Stream**: Real-time flow of orderbook data containing bids and asks with prices and quantities
- **Orderbook Snapshot**: Current state of buy/sell orders at various price levels for a trading pair
- **Trading Pair**: Asset pair being traded (e.g., ETH/USDT) with associated exchange information
- **Connection State**: Status of the API connection including authentication, subscription status, and health
