# Phase 0: Research & Analysis

## Executive Summary
Research conducted to understand Connex API capabilities for replacing direct WebSocket connections to CEX exchanges (Binance, OKX) with a unified API service.

## Research Findings

### 1. Connex API Overview
**Decision**: Use Connex as a unified gateway for multiple exchange connections
**Rationale**:
- Reduces connection complexity from managing multiple WebSocket connections
- Provides unified interface across exchanges
- Promises lower latency and transaction fees
**Alternatives considered**:
- Keep direct exchange connections (rejected: higher maintenance)
- Use other aggregation services (rejected: Connex specifically requested)

### 2. Supported Exchanges
**Decision**: Target Binance and OKX support through Connex
**Rationale**: Both exchanges are currently supported by Connex
**Current Status**: ✅ Confirmed support for both exchanges

### 3. API Communication Method
**Decision**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Options identified**:
- WebSocket streams for real-time market data (likely preferred for orderbook)
- REST API for polling-based updates
**Action Required**: Need to access full API documentation to determine optimal approach

### 4. Authentication
**Decision**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Research findings**:
- API requires authentication (API key based on standard practice)
- Need to obtain API credentials from Connex
**Action Required**: Request API credentials and documentation access

### 5. Data Format Compatibility
**Decision**: Implement adapter pattern to maintain backward compatibility
**Rationale**:
- Current system expects specific orderbook format from aggregator.py
- Connex likely has different data structure
- Adapter will transform Connex format to existing format
**Implementation approach**:
```python
class ConnexOrderbookAdapter:
    def transform_to_legacy_format(self, connex_data):
        # Transform Connex orderbook to existing format
        pass
```

### 6. Rate Limits & Performance
**Decision**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Research needed**:
- Connex API rate limits for market data
- Latency expectations vs current direct connections
- Connection stability and reconnection handling

### 7. Implementation Strategy with Jupyter
**Decision**: Use Jupyter notebook for iterative development
**Rationale**:
- Allows real-time testing of API connections
- Interactive exploration of data formats
- Easy visualization of orderbook data for validation
**Approach**:
1. Create research notebook for API exploration
2. Test connection methods in cells
3. Validate data format transformations
4. Performance testing in notebook before integration

### 8. Trading Pairs Support
**Decision**: Focus on ETH/USDT and ETH/USDC pairs
**Rationale**: These are the pairs currently used in the arbitrage system
**Verification needed**: Confirm these pairs are available through Connex

## Technical Architecture

### Current Implementation
```
Binance WebSocket → cex_streams.py → Event Queue → Aggregator
OKX WebSocket    → cex_streams.py → Event Queue → Aggregator
```

### Proposed Implementation
```
Connex API → connex_client.py → adapter → cex_streams.py → Event Queue → Aggregator
```

### Key Components
1. **connex_client.py**: New module for Connex API interaction
2. **ConnexOrderbookAdapter**: Transform Connex data to legacy format
3. **Modified cex_streams.py**: Route through Connex instead of direct connections

## Jupyter Development Plan

### Notebook Structure
```python
# Cell 1: Setup and imports
import asyncio
import aiohttp
import json
from typing import Dict, List

# Cell 2: Connex connection test
async def test_connex_connection():
    # Test basic connectivity
    pass

# Cell 3: Data format exploration
def explore_orderbook_format(connex_data):
    # Analyze and visualize data structure
    pass

# Cell 4: Adapter implementation
class ConnexOrderbookAdapter:
    # Transform logic
    pass

# Cell 5: Performance testing
async def measure_latency():
    # Compare with direct connection
    pass

# Cell 6: Integration test
async def test_with_aggregator():
    # Validate end-to-end flow
    pass
```

## Open Questions Requiring Resolution

1. **API Access**: How to obtain Connex API credentials?
2. **Documentation**: Need full API documentation for:
   - WebSocket endpoint URLs
   - Message formats and protocols
   - Subscription methods
   - Error handling
3. **Data Format**: Exact structure of Connex orderbook data
4. **Rate Limits**: Any restrictions on connection frequency or data requests?
5. **Failover**: How does Connex handle exchange outages?

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Latency Impact**: Additional hop through Connex may increase latency
- **Data Consistency**: Format differences may cause integration issues
- **Dependency Risk**: Adding external service dependency

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement comprehensive logging for debugging
- Create fallback to direct connections if needed
- Extensive testing in Jupyter before production integration
- Monitor latency metrics closely

## Next Steps (Phase 1)
1. Obtain Connex API credentials and full documentation
2. Create Jupyter research notebook
3. Implement and test connection methods
4. Design data model and contracts
5. Create adapter for backward compatibility

## Conclusion
The migration to Connex API is technically feasible but requires additional information about API specifics. The use of Jupyter for development will enable rapid prototyping and validation. The adapter pattern will ensure backward compatibility with the existing arbitrage system.
